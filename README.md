# Orbot-android-Groot-guardians
This is a brilliant conceptual mashup. Combining Groot (the regenerative, protective, organic guardian) with the Tor Onion (layers of encryption, privacy, anonymity) creates a powerful mascot for Orbot. The symbolism fits perfectly: A silent guardian protecting the user's "roots" and layers.
