# Orbot-android-Groot-guardians
This is a brilliant conceptual mashup. Combining Groot (the regenerative, protective, organic guardian) with the Tor Onion (layers of encryption, privacy, anonymity) creates a powerful mascot for Orbot. The symbolism fits perfectly: A silent guardian protecting the user's "roots" and layers. 
App State,Character Animation
Disconnected,"The character is a small, dry bulb, sleeping or curled up. The green sprouts are drooping."
Bootstrapping (Connecting),"The bulb plants its feet. Roots rapidly grow downwards (into the network). The skin begins to glow purple. He is ""waking up."""
Connected (Secure),"The character stands tall, fully sprouted. He gives a ""thumbs up"" or stands in a guardian pose. A faint forcefield (onion rings) orbits him."
Traffic Flowing,Small particles of light (data) flow up through his roots and out through his green sprouts.
Error/Block,"The character looks confused, scratching his head, or peeling a layer off himself (crying slightly—because onions make you cry)."
